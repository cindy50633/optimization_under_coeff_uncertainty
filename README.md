# Linear Optimization with Fluctuated Coefficients

## Overview
This repository addresses an imaginative optimization challenge centered around minimizing a linear objective function under the influence of coefficient fluctuation.

The essence of the challenge is divided into two main theoretical subproblems for clarity and depth in exploration.
The primary intrigue lies in navigating the uncertainty of fluctuating coefficients $a, b,$ and $c$,
each adhering to non-negativity constraints and a summation constraint that together shape the solution landscape.

## Imagination Problem Definition
Given a linear objective function defined by $ax + by + cz$, the task is to find the set of $(x, y, z)$ results into minimum possible value, considering:
- Coefficients $a, b,$ and $c$ fluctuate within specified ranges.
- A set of constraints: $a + b + c = 1$ and $a \geq 0$, $b \geq 0$, $c \geq 0$.
- A predefined table of $(x, y, z)$ combinations.

## Subproblems Breakdown

### Subproblem 1: Coefficient Combination Generation and Filtering

#### Objective
Identify all feasible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that adhere to their respective fluctuation ranges and the constraints of non-negativity and their sum equaling 1.

#### Theoretical Approach
- **Constraints Integration**: Highlighting the role of $a, b, c \geq 0$ and $a + b + c = 1$ in shaping the feasible space of coefficient combinations.
- **Generation Methodology**: The theoretical underpinning for generating and evaluating coefficient combinations within the given ranges.

#### Input/Output
- **Input**: Specified fluctuation ranges for $a$, $b$, and $c$.
- **Output**: A set of all valid $a$, $b$, $c$ combinations that satisfy the above conditions.
